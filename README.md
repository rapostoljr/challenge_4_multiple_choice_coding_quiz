# Coding Multiple Choice Quiz

## DESCRIPTION
I created this project to create a quiz to test participants knowledge of JavaScript. This also helped me to practice what I have learned in class and showcase it here. From showing my knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, as well as CSS. Although this was challenging, I never gave up and kept trying to figure out what was wrong. By doing this, it helped to expand my knowledge and my understanding of all these languages. I was motivated to show that I have a better understanding from when I first started the class.

## HOW TO USE
To begin the quiz, hit 'START QUIZ'. \
To view the current High Scores, click 'View Highscores' on the top left of the screen.

Once the quiz has begun, you cannot go back. You will have 60 seconds to finish the quiz.
The timer is located on the top right of the screen and will count down. You will be given a series of questions. If you choose an incorrect answer, you will be deducted 10 seconds. Once all questions are finish or the timer reaches 0, your quiz will end and then you will be prompted to enter your initials to possibly be on the leaderboards.
